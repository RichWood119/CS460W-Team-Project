Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications
(Based on IEEE Standard 830)
1. Introduction: This section contains an overview of the complete document.
  1.1 Purpose What is the purpose of this document, and for whom is it written?
    The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements and specifications of the software package that will be developed in the future. It will serve as a guideline that we can refer back to when going through with the future steps of the development process.

  1.2 Scope An identification of the product to be developed, what it do (and what does it not do), why is the product being developed (including a precise description of its benefits, goals and objectives)?
    The software package being developed will work as an application used by hospitals to register patients in the database along with their medical history and personal information. It will then be able to be accessed by various staff roles of said hospital which can all edit the data in a different way. For example. Nurses can order tests but doctors will be able to prescribe medication and see the results of said tests. In addition, each hospital case will be forwarded to a billing department which will have zero access to private information other than billing for the given services.

2. General Description This section contains a description of matters that concern the overall product and its requirements. It provides a perspective for understanding the specific requirements from section 3 of this document.

2.1 Product perspective Does it concern an independent product or is it part of a larger product? In the later case, the other components should be identified, and the
interfaces with those components should be described. In this section, we also give
an identification of the hardware to be used.

Identification: The software may interface with other components within the hospital's broader information system. Identify interfaces with existing hospital databases, patient records, or external systems that may contribute or retrieve information.
Interactions: Clarify how the emergency room management system interacts with other hospital systems, ensuring seamless data flow and integration.

2.3 User characteristics An indication of general user characteristics, in as far as these are relevant for the requirements specification. Experience, training and technical
expertise of future users may influence specific requirements of the system to be
Developed.

Experience: Admitting staff may have varying levels of experience in handling patient information and using software systems.
Training: Training programs may be required to familiarize admitting staff with the user-friendly form interface for capturing patient traits.
Technical Expertise: Basic technical skills are expected, including data entry and interaction with graphical user interfaces.
2.3.2 Nurses
Experience: Nurses are experienced healthcare professionals with knowledge of medical procedures and patient care.
Training: Training may be necessary for utilizing the system's functionalities, such as ordering X-rays and lab tests.
Technical Expertise: Moderate technical skills are expected, with proficiency in using the system for accessing vitals and medical history.
2.3.3 Doctors
Experience: Doctors are highly experienced medical professionals with expertise in diagnosis and treatment.
Training: Training may be required for utilizing the system's prescribing and diagnosing functionalities.
Technical Expertise: Moderate to advanced technical skills are expected, particularly in managing patient records and making medical decisions within the system.

2.4 General Constraints An indication of any other constraints that apply. These may concern government regulations, hardware constraints, security regulations, and so
on. Again, we are concerned with the rationale at this point. A further elaboration
follows in section 3 of this document.

-Compliance with healthcare data privacy regulations (HIPAA, CCPA).
-Time constraints for the project completion.
-Compatibility with existing hospital policies and procedures.

2.5 Assumptions and dependencies This does not concern constraints on the system being developed, but things which may influence the requirements specification once they change. As an example, we may think of the availability of certain supporting
software, such as some given operating system or numeric library. If that operating
system or library turns out not to be available, the requirements specification will
have to be adapted accordingly.

-The system assumes that database management will be handled by one person at a time.
-Dependency on server maintenance and login functionality, with one person maintaining the server for now (TBD for future enhancements).

3. Specific Requirements This section contains all the details which are relevant for the
design phase to follow. The ordering given here is just one way to present the specific
requirements in a logical way. Specific requirements should be such that one may
objectively determine whether they are fulfilled or not.

3.1 Functional Requirements In this subsection, a description is given of how the
transportation of inputs to outputs is achieved. The description given for each class
of functions, and sometimes for each individual function. To a certain extent, this
description can be seen as a solution to the user. This component of the requirement
specification is the main starting point for the design phase.

3.1.1 Functional requirement 1

3.1.1.1 Introduction A description of the purpose of this function and the
approaches and techniques used. The introduction should include
information to clarify the intent of the function.
  Once a patient's information is within the database, hospital staff will be able to pull their file up and be able to edit their file based on the permissions of said hospital staff, different roles will have different permissions. 

3.1.1.2 Inputs A precise description of the function’s inputs(source,
quantities, range of acceptable values, and the like).
  The inputs will be a variety of data fields that each hospital role will be able to see and interpret. These fields range from basic patient information such as name, address, medical history, allergies, prescribed medicine, etc. As more hospital roles are introduced, more fields are availible such as, new prescriptions, requested tests, test results, discharge instructions, billing information, and prices.

3.1.1.3 Processing A definition of the operations that must be performed,
such as checking for acceptable values, reaction to abnormal
situations, or a description of algorithms to be used. As an
example of the later, one may think of the use of some
mathematical model for strength computations within a CADprogram.
  The operations that will mostly be used will primarily be a series of checks to see if the signed in user has access to the information that they are either trying to edit or view. An example of an abormal situation would be something such as a nurse being checked into the hospital as a patient. It would need to be handled how they would have access to their own file becuase their nurse credentials would give them more permissions than those of a normal patient. Algorithms would be used in the billing sector to calculate the patients balance.

3.1.1.4 Outputs A precise description of the outputs(destination,
quantities, error messages, and the like).
  Editing the data would result in the next person in the chain of command being able to view and edit this information. In the end, once the services provided are sent to billing, the final output would be the patient's final balance. Error messages would include things such as someone trying to access something that their permissions do not allow or abnormal cases as listed above.

3.2 External interface requirements

3.2.1 User interfaces A description of the characteristics of the user interfaces, such as screen layout, function keys, help functions. In order to support testing, verifiable requirements regarding learning time for the system
functions should be included either here or in some subsection of

3.5 (Attributes).

3.2.2 Hardware interfaces A description of the logical characteristics of
hardware interfaces, such as interface protocols, or screen-oriented versus
line-oriented terminal control.

3.2.3 Software interfaces A description of software needed, such as a certain operating system or subroutine package. Interfaces to other application
software is also discussed here.

3.2.4 Communications interfaces An example is a communication protocol
for LANs.

LAN Protocol: Here we will discuss the communication protocol used within the hospital's local network to ensure seamless data transfer.
Data Encryption: Here we will address any encryption protocols applied to secure communication between system components.

3.3 Performance requirements Performance requirements encompass both static and dynamic requirements. Static requirements concern, amongst others, the number of terminals to be connected and the number of users that can be handled concurrently. Dynamic requirements concern the operational performance of the system: how frequently will certain functions be called for and how fast should the system’s reaction be. It is important that these requirements be stated in measurable terms.

Response Time Targets: For response time targets, we will define acceptable response times for different system functions (e.g., patient record retrieval, billing information access).
Peak Usage Scenarios: For peak usage scenarios we will identify scenarios that represent peak usage (e.g., simultaneous access by multiple doctors and nurses) and set performance expectations accordingly.

3.4 Design constraints Design constraints may result from such things as
the prescribed use of certain standards or hardware.

3.4.1 Standards compliance Which existing standards or regulations must be followed, and what requirements result from these. For example, certain
report formats or audit procedures may be prescribed.
-The system shall comply with relevant standards and regulations in emergency room operations.

3.4.2 Hardware limitations A description of the characteristics of the
hardware environment, in as far as they lead to software requirements. An
example of this might be the amount of memory available.
-The system shall operate within the specified hardware environment, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance.

3.5 Attributes In this section, particular attention is paid to quality aspects. These
requirements must be measurable and verifiable. They must be stated in objective
terms. The subsections below by no means comprise a complete list of such
Attributes.

3.5.1 Availability Factors that guarantee a certain level of availability, such as restart procedures. In this subsection we may also enlist requirements
regarding fault tolerance (with respect to both hardware failures and
software failures).
-The system shall ensure a high level of availability, with restart procedures in case of failures.

3.5.2 Security Requirements regarding unauthorized access and other forms of misuse. Certain cryptographic techniques may be prescribed, and we
may put constraints on the communication between different parts of the
System.
-Access control mechanisms shall be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to patient records.

3.5.3 Maintainability Requirements to guarantee a certain level of
maintainability of the system, such as a maximum allowable coupling
between components.
-The system shall be designed for easy maintenance, minimizing coupling between components.

3.6 Other requirements A description of requirements that are specific to certain
software, and which have not been discussed yet.
-To be determined based on further discussions and specific software features that may arise during development.
